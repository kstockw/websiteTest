My name is Kayden Stockwell and I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia studying developmental psychology with a concentration in quantitative methods. Under the supervision of Dr. Vikram Jaswal, I investigate autistic social interaction and how autistic people are percieved. I am particurally interested in live, dyadic interactions and in the [Double Empathy Problem](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09687599.2012.710008).

Outside of the lab, I am passionate about increasing access for disabled students in higher education and am active in several local LGBTQ+ organizations. I also enjoy working with students to support their understanding of course content, exploring their research interests, and deciding if graduate school is the right path for them.
