## **Social Media**

I co-run the [@DisInGradSchool](https://twitter.com/DisInGradSchool) Twitter account with [Cait Kirby](https://caitkirby.com/). We aim to provide connections and resources for disabled graduate students. In October 2020, we released [daily actions](https://t.co/LJJ5xI7dcj?amp=1) that disabled students and non-disabled allies could take to work to increase accessibility in the academy. We also appeared on the Dear Grad Student podcast to discuss ableism in academia.
